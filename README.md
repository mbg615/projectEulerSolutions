# projectEulerSolutions
This repo will house my solutions for the problems on projecteuler.net

As I solve more problems I will add them.
## Background
I am currently working through solving the problems on [projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/archives) in my free time. Currently, the solutions will be written in either C, Python, or C++. My current focus is C++ therefore those solutions will be the newest.
