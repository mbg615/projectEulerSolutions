# projectEulerSolutions
This repo will house my solutions for the problems on projecteuler.net

As I solve more problems I will add them.
## Background
I am currently working through solving the problems on [projecteuler.net](projecteuler.net) in my free time. Currently, the solutions will be written in either C, Python, or both, and C++ solutions may be added later once I feel I have an adequate understanding of C.
